# Asteroids (the famous space-themed video game) Simulator
Great thanks to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61eX0bFAsYs&t=535s which gives me a perfect opportunity to learn something about Pygame and Sprites.<br />
I added more features than this tutorial and I plan to add more of them to make this game better!<br />
I also wrap this game into a .exe file (not upload here) so I can easily distribute this game to my friends!
